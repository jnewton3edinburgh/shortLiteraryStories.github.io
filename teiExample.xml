  <head>Chapter 1: The Manor House</head>
  <p><name type="person">Charles</name> hadn't visited the manor
    house since <date when="1955-04-10">Easter, 1955</date>,
    and now he remembered why.</p>
  <p><said>Hullo</said>, he called out as he walked up the drive,
    and then, as if to himself, <said>To be or not to be?, to
    walk or not to walk...oh, <emph>hang</emph> it all!</said>
    His meditation on Hamlet was interrupted as he collided
    with a peacock. <said xml:lang="fr">Sacr√© bleu!</said> he
    exclaimed with irritation, his <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</foreign> completely
    deserting him. It was going to be a long week. His catalog of
    irritations included:
    <list>
       <item><label>1.</label> The weather</item>
       <item><label>2.</label> The peacocks</item>
       <item><label>3.</label> His meagre grasp of French</item>
    </list>
